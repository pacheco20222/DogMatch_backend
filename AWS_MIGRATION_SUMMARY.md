DB_NAME=dogmatch_db
DB_PASSWORD="Pajarito1234#"
DB_PORT=3306
DB_USER=bentheblaster
```

## Migration Steps Performed

### 1. Database Connection Testing
- Created `test_db_connection.py` script
- Verified connection to AWS RDS MySQL instance
- Confirmed database was empty and ready for tables

### 2. Configuration Updates
Updated `app/config.py` to handle AWS RDS SSL properly:
- Removed SSL verification parameters from connection string
- Added `SQLALCHEMY_ENGINE_OPTIONS` for SSL configuration
- Simplified database URL parsing

### 3. Flask-Migrate Initialization
```bash
flask db init
```
- Created `migrations/` directory
- Generated Alembic configuration files
- Set up version control for database schema

### 4. Migration Generation
```bash
flask db migrate -m "Initial migration with all tables"
```
- Generated migration file: `8f8b7d456872_initial_migration_with_all_tables.py`
- Auto-detected all 8 model tables plus alembic_version table

### 5. Migration Application
```bash
flask db upgrade
```
- Applied migration to AWS MySQL database
- Created all tables with proper relationships and constraints

---

## Database Schema Created

### Tables (9 total)
1. **users** - User accounts (owners, shelters, admins)
   - JWT authentication with 2FA support
   - Profile photos (S3 integration)
   - Role-based access control

2. **dogs** - Dog profiles
   - Owner relationship
   - Personality, health, and behavior attributes
   - Location and availability settings
   - Adoption-specific fields

3. **photos** - Dog photos
   - S3 storage integration
   - Primary photo designation
   - Metadata (size, dimensions, content type)

4. **matches** - Swipe matches between dogs
   - Tinder-style matching logic
   - Mutual like detection
   - Match status tracking

5. **messages** - Chat messages
   - Real-time messaging support
   - Read status tracking
   - Support for text, images, and location

6. **events** - Community events
   - Meetups, training, adoption fairs
   - Registration and capacity management
   - Location and pricing information

7. **event_registrations** - Event sign-ups
   - Payment processing
   - Check-in/check-out tracking
   - Emergency contact information

8. **blacklisted_tokens** - JWT token revocation
   - Token blacklisting for logout
   - Expiration tracking

9. **alembic_version** - Migration version tracking
   - Alembic internal table

---

## Verification Results

### Connection Test ✅
- Successfully connected to AWS RDS MySQL
- Database accessible from local development environment
- SSL connection working properly

### Table Creation ✅
All 9 tables created successfully with:
- Proper primary keys and auto-increment
- Foreign key relationships
- Unique constraints
- Check constraints
- Indexes on email and username
- ENUM types for status fields

### Flask Model Queries ✅
All models can successfully query the database:
- User: 0 records
- Dog: 0 records
- Event: 0 records
- Match: 0 records
- Message: 0 records
- EventRegistration: 0 records
- Photo: 0 records
- BlacklistedToken: 0 records

---

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
1. `test_db_connection.py` - Database connection testing script
2. `verify_flask_db.py` - Flask app database verification script
3. `migrations/` - Flask-Migrate directory with version control
4. `migrations/versions/8f8b7d456872_initial_migration_with_all_tables.py` - Initial migration

### Modified Files
1. `app/config.py` - Updated database configuration for AWS RDS

---

## Next Steps

### 1. Data Seeding (Optional)
If you want to populate the database with test data:
```bash
# Create a seeding script or use existing seed.py
python seed.py
```

### 2. Backend Testing
Test API endpoints to ensure they work with the new database:
```bash
# Start the backend server
python run.py
```

### 3. Frontend Configuration
Update frontend `config.js` if needed to point to the correct backend URL.

### 4. Deployment
When deploying to Render or other platforms:
- Update environment variables with AWS RDS credentials
- Ensure SSL configuration is correct for production
- Run migrations on production: `flask db upgrade`

---

## Important Notes

### SSL Configuration
- AWS RDS uses self-signed certificates
- SSL is enabled but certificate verification is disabled
- This is acceptable for development; consider proper SSL certificates for production

### Security Considerations
- Database credentials are in `.env` file (gitignored)
- Password contains special characters (properly URL-encoded in DATABASE_URL)
- JWT tokens use secure secret key
- 2FA support enabled for enhanced security

### Migration Management
- Always create migrations for schema changes: `flask db migrate -m "description"`
- Apply migrations: `flask db upgrade`
- Rollback if needed: `flask db downgrade`
- Never edit applied migrations; create new ones for changes

---

## Troubleshooting

### If Connection Fails
1. Check AWS RDS security group allows your IP
2. Verify database credentials in `.env`
3. Ensure RDS instance is running
4. Check network connectivity

### If Migration Fails
1. Verify database is empty or in expected state
2. Check for syntax errors in models
3. Review migration file for issues
4. Use `flask db stamp head` to mark current state

---

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

Your AWS MySQL database is now fully configured and ready for use with the DogMatch backend!

- ✅ Database connection verified
- ✅ All tables created successfully
- ✅ Flask models can query the database
- ✅ Ready for data seeding and API testing
- ✅ Migration system in place for future schema changes
